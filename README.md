### Prerequisites

## How to setup environment

For now we encourage you to use Anaconda package manager and creation of the environments.
In order to create an environment you have to run the following command providing the environment name:

```
conda env create -n <your_environment_name> -f enviroment.yml
```

To activate the environment you have to run the following command:

```
activate <your_environment_name>
```

After running this command you will see something like this:

```
(<name_of_environment) C:\Windows\system32>
```

To deactivate environment run:

```
deactivate
```
